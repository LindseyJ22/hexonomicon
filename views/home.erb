	Life is nasty, brutish and short. Sometimes there seems to be no justice in the universe. Our good deeds and best efforts are rarely rewarded, while we watch corrupt people in positions of power thrive in this wicked world. You've wonder why. You've looked for answers. But what you probably didn't know is that behind every sucess in this world lies secret dark magic. The Kim Kardashians and Dr Phils of this world have been harnessing the arcane energy of the demiurge, Yaldaboath. And now you can, too.

	"But it takes years of training!" you exclaim. "I haven't fostered a relationship with a spiritual animal companion that can guide me through the shadow realms!"<br>
	That's a good point. A novice should never attempt such powerful magic without years of astral projecting, lest they find their bones being gnawed on for eternity by the gaping mouth of Ma'at.<br>
	That is why we will brave the unknoweable nether so you don't have to! Continue to our <a href="/order">Order Page</a> and peruse the services we provide.
