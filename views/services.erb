	<h1>Flatulence Jinx</h1>
	Síoraí Lig Sé Broim, or the curse of eternal flatulence, is one of the most vile and powerful hexes from ancient lore. With nary a magical fruit involved, the vexed will toot and toot to the end of their days. This was the very curse that St. Padraig bestowed upon the snakes in Ireland to drive them into the sea...

	<h1>The Odorous Ordeal</h1>
	Bu Yao Wen, or The Oderous Ordeal, will haunt your victim with an ominous offal odor. This vexation has been handed down from one court magician to another for thousands of years in the sorcery circles of China. The ancient philosopher and Tephramancer, Hu Fa Ting, used this dangerous curse on the Qin emporer's would-be assassins. They had to find new jobs as fishmongers, as they could never sneak up on another soul again.

	<h1>The Plague of Powerlessness</h1>
	Níl aon Fhuinneamh Agat is a terrible torment that should be spared for only your worst enemies. It causes the cursed to forever forget to plug their divices in on time. They may charge their laptop overnight and cry out in rage in the morning when they come to discover it was not plugged into the wall. The chargers in their car will never be compatible with electronic devices, and they will install the most power-hungry, unclosable apps.
